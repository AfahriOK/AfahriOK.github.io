# Overview
My name is Afahri Kerr and my goal is to become a software engineer. I first started learning to code when I joined the computer science program in February 2022. I had absolutely no experience but I have always had an interest in technology so I knew I would do whatever it takes to succeed. The program has taught me many skills and programming languages necessary to achieve my goal not limited to Python, Java, C++, HTML, and SQL. Above that, it has given me a greater appreciation and understanding of the technologies that are in use today and a burning desire to be a part of the ones to come. I made this site in order to showcase my current abilities through projects.

It takes a great deal of planning and focus to make a project successful. You have to meet the needs of the client while also minimizing security risks and producing readable bug free code. These first 2 projects were used for my capstone course at SNHU. I had to choose artifacts to enhance across 3 categories which were software design and engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases. I decided to use 2 artifacts and performed a code review which you can view [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbIkUvgf_ck).

## Software Design and engineering / Databases: Artifact 1 - Weight Tracker App Enhancement

I chose to enhance my weight tracker mobile application across these categories. The artifact originated from course CS-330: Mobile Architect & Programming. This project showcases a wide range of abilites and was built in Android Studio using the Java and XML programming languages. The goal of this project was to design and build a mobile application that will allow the user to store their daily weights in a database along with a weight goal. The user should then be able to see each of their entries and be given an option to receive SMS notifications upon achivement of their goal.

<ins>List of Enhancements</ins>
1. Designed and implemented an account creation screen.
2. Added input validation to the username and password fields.
3. Merged the User and Goal tables in the database.
4. Designed and implemented an Encryptor class to encrypt user passwords.
5. Ensured that the database and cursor were closed in each function.
6. Implemented a button to clear entire list on the weight screen.
7. Improved If/Else logic of the functions.
8. Fixed font visibility and other warnings.
9. Improved variable names and code spacing.
10. Added JavaDoc comments to functions.
11. Removed unneccessary comments and variables.

## Algorithms and Data Structures: Artifact 2 - Testing Enhancement

I chose to enhance my final project from course CS-320: Software Test Automation & QA. This project showcases my ability to design and test my programs using efficient techniques such as boundary analysis. I built this project in Eclipse using the Java programming language and Junit5 for testing. The goal of this project was to design and test 3 classes and their associated service class for an appointment program given a set of requirements.

<ins>List of Enhancements</ins>
1. Changed data structure to a HashMap.
2. Added a @BeforeEach initialization method in my testing files.
3. Added JavaDoc comments to functions.
4. Added a header comment box to show the overall purpose and requirements of each file.
5. Improved variable names and code spacing.
6. Removed redundant code and unneccesary comments.

The skills for this artifact demonstrate an ability to design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices. My initial program was built using an array which caused the performance to be O(n) where n is the number of objects in the array. I changed the array to a HashMap using the unique ID of the objects as a key which improved the performance to O(1).

I demonstrated an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals. Testing is a very important part of creating error free code. I used boundary analysis to identify the edge cases of the requirements and designed my tests around them to ensure functionality. I then used Junit5 to test my code coverage which came out to 100% for my object and service class files.

I also show an ability to design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts. I added a comment header box to my files to display the program requirements, purpose, test coverage, and most recent date that I updated the file. I also added JavaDoc comments to the functions so that a new programmer can easily understand the code and make changes as needed.
