# Overview
My name is Afahri Kerr and my goal is to become a software engineer. I first started learning to code when I joined the computer science program in February 2022. I had absolutely no experience but I knew that I have always had an interest in technology so i would do whatever it takes to succeed. The program has taught me many skills and programming languages necessary to achieve my goal not limited to Python, Java, C++, HTML, and SQL. I made this site in order to showcase my current abilities through projects.

It takes a great deal of planning and focus to make a project successful. You have to meet the needs of the client while also minimizing security risks and producing readable bug free code. These first 2 projects were used for my capstone course at SNHU. I had to choose artifacts to enhance across 3 categories which were software design and engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases. I decided to use 2 artifacts and performed a code review which you can watch [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbIkUvgf_ck).

## Software Design and engineering / Databases: Artifact 1 - Weight Tracker App Enhancement

I chose to select my weight tracker mobile application to enhance across these categories. The artifact originated from course CS-330: Mobile Architect & Programming. It was built in Android Studio using the Java and XML programming languages. The goal of this project was to design and build a mobile application that will allow the user to store their daily weights in a database along with a weight goal. The user should be able to see each of their entries and also be able to opt in to a SMS notification upon achivement of their goal.

<ins>List of Enhancements</ins>
1. Designed and implemented an account creation screen.
2. Added input validation to the username and password fields.
3. Merged the User and Goal tables in the database.
4. Designed and implemented an Encryptor class to encrypt user passwords.
5. Ensured that the database and cursor were closed in each function.
6. Implemented a button to clear entire list on the weight screen.
7. Improved If/Else logic of the functions.
8. Fixed font visibility and other warnings.
9. Improved variable names and code spacing to promote readability.
10. Added JavaDoc comments to functions.
11. Removed unneccessary comments and variables.
