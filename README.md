# Overview
My name is Afahri Kerr and my goal is to become a software engineer. I first started learning to code when I joined the computer science program in February 2022. I had absolutely no experience but I knew that I have always had an interest in technology so i would do whatever it takes to succeed. The program has taught me many skills and programming languages necessary to achieve my goal not limited to Python, Java, C++, HTML, and SQL. I made this site in order to showcase my current abilities through projects.

It takes a great deal of planning and focus to make a project successful. You have to meet the needs of the client while also minimizing security risks and producing readable bug free code. These first 2 projects were used for my capstone course at SNHU. I had to choose artifacts to enhance across 3 categories which were software design and engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases. I decided to use 2 artifacts and performed a code review which you can watch [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbIkUvgf_ck).

## Software Design and engineering / Databases: Artifact 1 - Weight Tracker App Enhancement
I chose to select my weight tracker mobile application to enhance across these categories. The artifact originated from course CS-330: Mobile Architect & Programming. It was built in Android Studio using the Java and XML programming languages. The goal of this project was to design and build a mobile application that will allow the user to store their daily weights in a database along with a weight goal. The user should be able to see each of their entries and also be able to opt in to a SMS notification upon achivement of their goal.
